# standalone atmosphere

A standalone atmosphere shader for SHADERed and shadertoy (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/wlBXWK)

This repo is meant as a way to research and explain a (somewhat simple) atmospheric scattering implementation

Roadmap: 
 - chapman function for approximate optical depth
 - better overall integrator
 - planet shadow
 - multiple scattering
